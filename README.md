# CASCODE-LABS

Open source automation for the design of analog, mixed signal, and RF IC design

## Goals

- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers with an interest in design automation
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple processes and adjust to variations in specifications.
- Accelerate designer productivity improvement
- Lower the barrier to entry into IC design
