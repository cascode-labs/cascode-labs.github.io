# CASCODE-LABS

Cascode-labs is developing an open source automation kernel for the design of
analog, mixed signal, and RF IC designs.  Our projects are designed to work
with both other open-source design tools and proprietary design tools.

We are partnering with [MOSAIC](https://www.mosaic-ic.org/) to achieve 
these goals.

## Goals

- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers with an interest in
  design automation
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with
  basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple
processes and adjust to variations in specifications.
- Accelerate designer productivity improvement
- Lower the barrier to entry into IC design

## Projects

- [Viper](http://www.cascode-labs.org/viper/) IC design Environment
- [Viper-forge](http://www.cascode-labs.org/viper-forge/) community-led IC
design packages
- [Virtue](http://www.cascode-labs.org/virtue/) Cadence Virtuoso SKILL and
Python framework for easily integrating automated design projects into
Virtuoso.
- [Data-panels](http://www.cascode-labs.org/data-panels): Export
  data reports from simulation results to pptx slides
- [Morpheus](https://github.com/cascode-labs/morpheus):
Generate Maestro circuit test benches in Cadence Virtuoso
