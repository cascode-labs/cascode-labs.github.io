Cascode-labs is developing analog & RF IP designs for open-source hardware
integrated circuits. (OSHIC)  We also support a set of tools for the
designinging these IP blocks.

## Goals

- Design a basic set of analog and RF IP
- Improve analog & RF IP reuse
- Improve IP simulation and lab testing
  - Improve communication of results
  - Improve coverage
  - Enable process-independent test benches
- Encourage collaboration among designers with an interest in
  design automation
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple
processes and adjust to variations in specifications.
- Accelerate designer productivity
