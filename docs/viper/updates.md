# Back Drop Build v4 Updates

## Viper 5-8-24 Update

So far I've laid out my project Goals and my goals for this week. I also
started cleaning up and updating a "bandgaps" design project that uses Viper
to simulate a set of bandgap designs.

## Goals

- Create a process-independent circuit simulation test setup workflow
- Create an open-source EDA design environment as a devcontainer
- Create a design project management tool
- Demonstrate the use of this devcontainer to design usng codespaces from my
  Chromebook.
- Demonstrate the simulation workflow in the [bandgaps]() IP designs in SKY130A and the GF 180MCU

## Week 1 Goals

- Simulate the bandgaps repo inside the viper-ic devcontainer
- Add gui support for xschem to the devcontainer template: https://github.com/cascode-labs/viper-osic-docker-analog/issues/1
- Create an issue for the Design of the simulation environment: https://github.com/cascode-labs/viper/issues/22
