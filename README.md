## CASCODE-LABS

Open source automation for the design of analog, mixed signal, and RF IC design

### Goals

- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers with an interest in design automation
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple processes and adjust to variations in specifications.
- Get home in time for dinner every night

### Projects 

- [Viper](https://github.com/cascode-labs/viper) IC design Environment
- [viper-forge](http://www.cascode-labs.org/viper-forge/) community-led IC design packages
